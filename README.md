# ExplanationScore
This project includes SQL implementations of two scores -- SHAP score and RESP score.
This is part of the research from Dan Suciu and Maximilian Schleich on the explanation score.
The reference paper is in Explanation/deemScore.pdf. And these implemenatations show that these two scores mentioned in paper is efficient to use. 
This project also demonstrates a new approaching to implement similar explanation project: using SQL and database.
